## 1. "Data EDA & Visualization"
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (EDAV) project.
This project involves Exploring data, summarizing their main characteristics, often with visual to form better questions.
The 2 datasets used for this project are from [The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Collection](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection).
    1. The Artworks dataset
    2. The Artists dataset

The goal of this project is to allow myself to work with data, explore it, and visualize it to tell a story.
as part of my exploratory data analysis and visualization (EDAV), I was able to:
* check the missing values in all columns. paying attention that not all missing values will be `NaN`s. Making sure that non-nan values are valid.
* check data type of all columns and make sure they correspond with what I expected them to be. dates to be of `datetime` format, numbers to be of either `int` or `float`.
* plot distribution of numeric columns and histogram of categorical columns.
* calculate and visualize top 5 nationalities of artists
* calculate and visualize top 5 nationalities of artists by gender
* merge two dataframes using `ConstituentID` as the key
* pick a nationality and filter the merged data to find all artworks done by artists of that nationality. Figured out how to handle artworks that have multiple artists.
* Do additional analysis of the data that picked my interest.
